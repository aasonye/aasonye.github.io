<h1> My Favorite Book: Six of Crows by Leigh Bardugo </h1>


<p>
    My favorite book is <em>Six of Crows</em> <strong>by Leigh Bardugo</strong>. 
    It was one of the first books that I read again after a long break from reading for fun during high school. 
    At that time I was pretty busy with assignments and other commitments, so I only really read for class assignments. 
    This book is pretty popular nowadays, since it’s a YA Fantasy book. This genre is super popular right now, similarly to how YA Dystopian novels were hugely popular a couple years ago 
    (examples being <em>The Hunger Games, Maze Runner, Divergent, </em> etc.).

    The book is really interesting to me both because of the characters and the plot. 
    A short summary of the book is basically that six different teenagers in the city of Ketterdam (where crime and gangs are nothing out of the ordinary) come together to complete the common goal of recovering an inventor of a drug that enhances magical powers from a high-security prison. 
    The book has a cool feature where the point of view switches each chapter, switching between each member of the main cast. 
    The characters themselves (the main ones being Kaz Brekker, Inez Ghafa, Nina Zenik, Jasper Fahey, Wylan Van Eck, and Matthias Helvar) have such interesting personalities and backstories, leading to interactions that help carry the plot forward. 
    I highly recommend this book, so I’ll provide a link for you to buy it

    It has been two years since I’ve read the book though, so I’m interested to see if my opinions of the book have changed at all.
